# Dscord

Discord API wrapper's wrapper, ironically.

## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/thisgary/dscord

## Features

`dscord` - Provide simple setup for Discord bot hosting

`dscord/ext` - Discord.py extensions collection

    import dscord
    dscord.load('system') # load from dscord/ext
    dscord.run(TOKEN) # start bot with token

## Purpose

Solely for me to learn how to write a Discord bot

It is no longer actively maintained, since `dscord2` a thing now... that was, until someone dragged me out again

Oh, and I managed to implement temporal extension loading for Discord.py (bug?)
