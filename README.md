# Dscord

Discord API wrapper's wrapper, ironically.

## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/thisgary/descordlib

## Features

`descord/bot` - Provide simple setup for Discord bot hosting.

`descord/ext` - Discord.py extensions collection.

    from descord import bot, wake
    bot.load('system') # load ext from module
    bot.run(TOKEN) # start bot with token

## Purpose

Solely for me to learn how to write a Discord bot

It is no longer actively maintained, since `Dscord 2` a thing now

Oh, and I managed to implement temporal extension loading for Discord.py (bug?)
